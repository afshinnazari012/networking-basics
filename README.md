# Introduction to Computer Networks

This repository serves as my detailed study space for computer networks, an essential field in computer science and cybersecurity. Understanding networks is fundamental to grasp how data is transmitted, how devices communicate, and how to secure these communications.

## Topics Covered

- **Network Models:** OSI and TCP/IP models explaining different layers and their functions.
- **IP Addressing and Subnetting:** Concepts of IPv4, IPv6, subnet masks, and network segmentation.
- **Routing and Switching:** How routers and switches manage data traffic within and between networks.
- **Network Protocols:** Overview of common protocols such as TCP, UDP, HTTP, FTP, and DNS.
- **Security in Networks:** Basic principles of protecting network data, including encryption, firewalls, and VPNs.
- **Troubleshooting Tools:** Usage of tools like ping, traceroute, and Wireshark for diagnosing network issues.

## Goals

Through this repository, I intend to deepen my knowledge of how networks function, how to configure and manage them, and most importantly, how to protect them from cyber threats. I will document my learning, practical experiments, and useful resources.

I believe mastering computer networks is a vital step toward becoming a proficient cybersecurity professional and software developer.
